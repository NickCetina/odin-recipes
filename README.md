# odin-recipes
In this project, I will be using my learnt knowledge to attempt to build a simple recipe web page.

At the end of this work, I will (hopefully) be able to create very simple looking pages by using just HTML.

AT THE END, I WILL HAVE THE SKILLS TO:
-Self-taught simple concepts. 
-Have a better grasp at the uses of HTML.
-Develop self-sufficience.
